## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Bootstrap5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/) - CSS framework

### What I learned

I learned how to set the flexbox, grid and breakpoint in Bootstrap 5. Although I'm still confused about how to set the image size, to fit with the column or container in Bootstrap 5, that's why I set the image width and height to 100% instead of setting the image size in Bootstrap 5.
